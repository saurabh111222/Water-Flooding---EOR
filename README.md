# Water-Flooding---EOR
## The project focuses on developing an analytical model using python to predict waterflood recoveries from four sandstone reservoirs having oil of different viscosities and the reservoirs are assumed to be homogeneous. 
## After predicting the waterflood recoveries, cases were evaluated in detail to predict the increases in recovery on performing Chemical and Thermal EOR.
