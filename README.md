# Water-Flooding-EOR

## The project focuses on developing an analytical model using python to predict waterflood recoveries from four sandstone reservoirs having oil of different viscosities and the reservoirs are assumed to be homogeneous. 
## After predicting the waterflood recoveries, cases were evaluated in detail to predict the increases in recovery on performing Chemical and Thermal EOR.

## * Four oil fields ( Four Cases) are made available for acquisition to you.
## * You want to carry out due diligence of the four cases to set up your priority for investment
## * You want to draw exploitation strategy by drilling vertical wells and resources available with you are 2 drilling Rigs.
## * Time to drill a vertical well to a depth of 1000m ( Depth: 1000m) takes 1 month by Drilling Engineers and 1 more month for each drilled well to put on production by creating flowline and hooking up the well with facilities by two Production Deptt working parallelly.
## * 2 Rigs are used at the same time to drill the wells.
## * You want to generate potential of each field/case in terms of annual oil production, Fluid & water to be handled daily and final recovery. Finally economics has to be drawn.
